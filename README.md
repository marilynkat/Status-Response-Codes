## Description
This is a Python GUI program that takes in a URL and returns its status response code. \
It was created for learning purposes. \
Specifically, to familiarize myself with tkinter and networking concepts using Python.

## Instructions
1. Input a URL into the first textbox.
2. Click the button to produce it's status response code.
3. The URL will clear from the first textbox and its response code will appear in the lower textbox.
4. The history of status response codes will remain in the lower textbox and each new code will be added.
